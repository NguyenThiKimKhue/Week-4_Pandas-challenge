    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "The analysis of the City School dataset, which includes 39,170 students and a budget of $24,649,428, revealed significant insights into school performance. Key metrics were calculated, including average scores and passing rates for math and reading. The analysis identified Cabrera High School as the highest performing institution, with an overall passing rate of 94.13%, while Rodriguez High School was noted as the lowest performer. The overall passing rate across all schools was 65.17%, with specific passing rates of 74.98% for math and 85.80% for reading. Additionally, the data highlighted a correlation between school size and performance, as well as differences in performance based on school type.\n",

    "Conclusion:\n",
    "s\r\n",
    "1.\tImpact of School Size on Performance: The analysis indicates that smaller to medium-sized schools (with fewer than 2,000 students) tend to have higher overall passing rates compared to larger schools (with 2,000-5,000 students). This suggests that smaller schools may provide a more conducive learning environment that supports student succes\n",

    "2.\tComparison of School Types: The data demonstrates that Charter schools outperform District schools in math proficiency, with a passing rate of 93.62% compared to the District's 66.54%. This finding could imply that the educational approaches or resources available in Charter schools are more effective in enhancing math performance among studen\n",
    "   ts.\r\n",
    "These insights can be instrumental for stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding school budgets, resource allocation, and strategic planning for improving educational outcomes across the district.\r\n",
